# VS Code Extension: Jasmine Test Selector

This VS code extension provides a way to list all available ```describe``` and ```
it``` functions in an editor window. Selecting one list entry moves the cursor to the line of this test function.

This extension was inspired by the [IntelliJ Plugin "ddescriber"](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7233-ddescriber-for-jasmine)
